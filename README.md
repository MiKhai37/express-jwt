# Express JWT (micro project)

This project build a NodeJS JWT authentication server, with ExpressJS and PassportJS

# Tools and Techs

## NodeJS

Node.js is a free, open-sourced, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that lets developers write command line tools and server-side scripts outside of a browser.

## ExpressJS

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

## PassportJS

Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

## MongoDB (and MongoDB Atlas)

MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

MongoDB Atlas is an integrated suite of cloud database and data services to accelerate and simplify how you build with data.

## JWT

JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.
